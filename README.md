# DSA Project
## B-Tree Insertion and Visualization

A Python project that demonstrates B-Tree insertion with real-time visualization of node splits and key organization. It helps users understand how B-Trees maintain balance and efficient search operations — an essential concept in database indexing and file systems.

Features:

- Step-by-step visualization of B-Tree insertions

- Dynamic node splitting and balancing

- Interactive and educational tool for DSA learning
